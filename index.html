      Welcome to my island of wholesomeness! 🏝️ I hope you are doing splentastic, grab a drink 🍹 and enjoy my little intro:<br />
      <ul>
        <li>I want simple things in life: a post-scarcity future where aging and disease are non-existent and we live our best lives unraveling the mysteries of the universe 🌌 </li>
        <li>Speaking of the universe, getting into astronomy when I was 15 turned out to be a life changing decision and made me who I am right now. I knew the night sky as my own pocket (guess the idiom origin) and I still think stargazing is very underrated 🎑</li>
        <li>For the last five years I worked as a self-taught machine learning Swiss army knife, but I don’t limit my action space to “tech” or “professional background”. A lot of things I consider high-value require going above and beyond what looks like a neat career, and impact is the main thing I chase at the moment 🚀 (I don't think 🚀 is an appropriate emoji here but I needed something for consistency)</li>
        <li>I care a lot about safe AGI and Human Lifespan Extension and I am actively looking for effective ways for me to contribute! Besides that, I have dozens of ideas for cool stuff to build or do that are either fun or helpful or both. Stick around and give me a kick in the butt if I take too long to deliver! 🙂 </li>
        <li>I speak five languages, so if you talk to me in your native language there is a decent chance I will understand something! 🌎</li>
        <li>Currently going through my “Canadian immigrant without rights, friends and family” arc 🇨🇦</li>
        <li>Like everyone else, I’m juggling my own constraints like staying alive and sane in the world that does not make it easy to do good. Connecting with like-minded people helps a lot, and that’s why I decided to finally have some online presence! 💻</li>
        <li>Speaking of that, I am learning to interface with the online world, so feel free to give feedback on this website or anything that I do or say! I am open to criticism and will appreciate it 🤗</li>
      </ul>
      Hope you had fun getting to know me a little! Thanks for reading and have a great day!
